How to use your custom piggy bank image:

1. Save your piggy bank image in this folder (src/assets)
2. Rename it to something simple like "piggy-bank.png" (or keep your original name)
3. Open HomePage.js and add this import at the top of the file:
   
   import piggyBank from '../assets/your-image-name.png';  // <-- Update to your file name

4. In HomePage.js, find the commented sections and follow the instructions to use your image

Tips for the best looking piggy bank:
- Use a transparent PNG image if possible
- Make sure the image has enough empty space inside the piggy where the "fill" should appear
- The fill uses a green gradient from bottom to top, but you can change the color in the code
